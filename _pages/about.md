## About me

Hi! I'm Muzhou (Richard) Ma /mu ʈʂoʊ ma/ (马牧洲), a senior undergraduate at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am deeply intrigued by the information-theoretical interpretations of nature and how they shape the capabilities and limitations of computation. 

I believe the key to deepening our understanding of nature and opening up a new era of computation is to decode the intricate interplay between physics and information. So I started working in the intersection of Information theory, physics and computer science with a particular interest in **quantum information theory**. 

I've enjoyed a fruitful experience as an undergrad research fellow in [John Preskill's group](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/) at [IQIM,Caltech](https://iqim.caltech.edu/), hornored to be co-mentored by [John Preskill](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/), [Yu Tong](https://pratt.duke.edu/people/yu-tong/), and [Steven Flammia](https://sflammia.github.io/). At Tsinghua, I'm working on quantum information theory in [Xiongfeng Ma's group](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/maxiongfeng/) at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and photonic computation in [Lu Fang's group](https://www.luvision.net/) at [EE](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

**I am seeking a PhD position for Fall 2025.**
